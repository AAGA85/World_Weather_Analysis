# World_Weather_Analysis

In this module I support Jack to develop an app in order to help the users to find places where to spend their next vacation days based on their weather preferences. In order to meet that we used the OpenWeatherMap API to request weather data from each unique city, as well as, we used Google Maps and Places API to be able to provide hotels close to the suggested places. Additional to that, for this challenge, there was required to incorporate a new functionality, create a travel itinerary  and by using Google Maps Directions API, it was easy to create a travel route between the four cities.

- On *Deliverable 1* you will find the steps to retrive the weather data
- On *Deliverable 2* you will find the steps to create the customer travel destinations map
- On *Deliverable 3* you will find the steps to create the travel itinerary map
